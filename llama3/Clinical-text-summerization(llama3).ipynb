      "A 65-year-old male presented to the emergency department with symptoms of dizziness, passing out, visual changes, and tinnitus. He had a history of possible coronary artery disease, transient ischemic attack, arrhythmia, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. After admission, his blood pressure remained low-normal despite stopping Amlodipine, and further workup including telemetry monitoring, computed tomography of the head, EEG, and electrocardiogram were all normal or unremarkable. An incidental finding of a 5x4x3mm right middle cerebral artery aneurysm was detected on computed tomography of the head and neck. The patient's symptoms were likely due to orthostatic hypotension in the setting of Amlodipine, but he will need further monitoring as an outpatient for recurrence of symptoms and consideration of further workup.\n",

He had two prior suicide attempts and one psychiatric hospitalization, with a previous diagnosis of depression and refractory depression treated with six ketamine treatments.

He had no prior cardiac history, but did have risk factors including hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and tobacco use. Initial electrocardiogram showed nonspecific ST changes, while troponin was negative initially but became elevated on the second test. Cardiac catheterization revealed 2 serial lesions in the left anterior descending artery, which were treated with drug-eluting stents. The patient's hospital course was uneventful, and he remained chest pain-free throughout his stay. He was discharged on a regimen of medications, including aspirin, clopidogrel, verapamil, lisinopril, simvastatin, and nitroglycerin, with instructions to stop smoking and follow up with his primary care physician for further management.\n",

He was found to have elevated liver function tests (LFTs), creatine kinase, and international normalized ratio, indicating acute liver injury and rhabdomyolysis. He also had a small right pleural effusion on chest X-ray, which resolved during his hospital course. Hepatitis C was diagnosed, and it was suggested that the liver damage was secondary to ischemic injury superimposed on chronic liver disease from alcohol and hepatitis C. He received treatment for community-acquired pneumonia and was started on medications to prevent seizures and promote liver health. His condition improved over time, and he was discharged home with instructions to continue not drinking and taking his medications regularly.\n",
